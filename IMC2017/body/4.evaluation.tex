\section{Evaluation}
The development of NfvInsight is still in process. 
Although we have done most of automatic tools, the number of 
available VNF-chains is limited. In this section, we only 
demonstrate several preliminary experiments to basic functionality 
of the NfvInsight testbed. As shown in Figure \ref{network},
our experiments are conducted on two 
physical servers with Intel Xeon E5V3-2658 2.2GHz, 
12 cores, 32GB DRAM, 10Gbps NICs. The servers run 
CentOS 7 system, with Kubernetes 1.4 and Open vSwitch 2.5.1. 
We encapsulates VNFs with Docker 1.12.5 running Ubuntu 14.14.
We use NfvInsight to deploy VNF-chains on single server 
as well as two servers and measure network metrics 
such as throughput and latency.
In this section, we mainly evaluate the first two chains in Table \ref{chains}.

We measure throughput of each container using Docker API.
The transmit bytes and receive bytes are recorded two times
at the begin and end of test running respectively.
Throughput of each NF is calculated
by doing subtraction of transmit bytes and divid it by the testing time.
We also measured end-to-end request latency by modifying the workload generator Httperf.
It records the latency of each request and output the distribution of latencies.

Figure \ref{throughput} shows the topology of two chains
and the throughput are labeled on the arrows.
The direction of the arrows indicates the flow of the packets.



%\subsection{Latency}
