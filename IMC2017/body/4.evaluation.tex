\section{Evaluation}
The development of NfvInsight is still in process.
Although we have done most of automatic tools, the number of
available VNF-chains is limited. In this section, we only
demonstrate several preliminary experiments to basic functionality
of the NfvInsight testbed. As shown in Figure \ref{network},
our experiments are conducted on two
physical servers with Intel Xeon E5V3-2658 2.2GHz,
12 cores, 32GB DRAM, 10Gbps NICs. The servers run
CentOS 7 system, with Kubernetes 1.4 and Open vSwitch 2.5.1.
We encapsulates VNFs with Docker 1.12.5 running Ubuntu 14.14.
We use NfvInsight to deploy VNF-chains on single server
as well as two servers and measure network metrics
such as throughput and latency.
In this section, we mainly evaluate the first two chains in Table \ref{chains}.

We measure throughput of each VNF by using Docker API that
is able to record transmit bytes and receive bytes of each container. 
Throughput of each VNF is calculated
by doing subtraction of transmit bytes and dividing it by total testing time.
We also measure end-to-end latency of each request by modifying the workload generator Httperf,
which records the latency of each request and output the distribution of latencies.

Figure \ref{throughput} shows the topology of two chains
and the throughput are labeled on the arrows.
The direction of the arrows indicates the flow of the packets.
It is worth noting that 
we only need to modify 6 lines of configuration files
to form such two different VNF-chains. Once the configuration 
file is modified, we run only one command to deploy the two chains. 
This experiment demonstrate that NfvInsight is able to support 
fast configuration and deployment.


%\subsection{Latency}

  \end{minipage}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{e2e_latency} and Figure \ref{nat_latency} 
shows the end to end latency of SFC1 and SFC2 
as well as the per-packet latency of NAT in SFC1 respectively.
As mentioned before, to calculate per-packet latency, 
we slightly modified Httpperf to record latency of each request. 
For NAT's processing latency, NfvInsight leverages tcpdump to 
monitor and computer the latency of packets going through the NAT NFV. 
Currently, NfvInsight only provides two metrics, but we will add 
more metrics such as CPU utilization, memory working set size and cache miss rate.

The next experiments are conducted on two servers. Thank to 
Kerbuneters, NfvInsight can easily deploy VNFs on multiple servers. 
In our experiments, we use NfvInsight to deploy chain-1 and chain-2 
on two servers, as shown in Figure \ref{inter_throughput}. We can
see that the bandwidthes decrease compared to the deployment on
a single server. Then we modified 3 lines of the configuration file 
to increase the number of NAT and HAProxy instances, and deploy
the two chain again. By scaling out the two VNFs, the network 
bandwidths increase significantly, as shown in Figure \ref{inter_throughput}.
Thus, these experiments demonstrate that NfvInsight is able to 
perform the scale-out functionality, which is very important for NFV
deployment.
