\section{Conclusions}

This paper is addressing how to ease NFV deployment for research,
which has been one of the most time-consuming and painful step according 
to our survey.We propose an NFV benchmark suite NfvInsight to offer
researchers a self-contained testbed. We carefully chose 
a couple of representative VNFs and VNF-chains and adopted 
Kubernetes and docker to ease deployment. This paper prepsents
a work-in-process version of NfvInsight that already have five VNFs
and four VNF-chains. Preliminary experiments demonstrated
that NfvInsight is able to fast deploy NFV environment on single physical
server or multiple servers. Our future work is to complete the 
rest functionalities of NfvInsight and make it free and open-source to the
NFV research community.
